## TESTING DISCLAIMER

The majority of our tests will not work because they were written for the previous version of the webapp that still relied on using editor menus. Since the latest published version got rid of these editor menus, tests will have to be rewritten.

The newest version was pushed late June 10, 2021, the day of the due date. The testing team did not have the time to edit all the related tests. The core functionlity and interaction method was changed.

Some tests have been re-written since then. 

More information on the testing coverage can be found in the [Testing]((test/testing.md)) document.
