## TESTING DISCLAIMER

The newest version was pushed late June 10, 2021, the day of the due date. 
The testing team strive to edit all the related tests to make most of the tests working for our latest version.

More information on the testing coverage can be found in the [Testing]((test/testing.md)) document.

Also the test, inclucing unit/e2e testings, are functional and working locally following the procedure in [Testing]((test/testing.md)) document. However these tesstings are not working in the github actions and we took the suggestions from TA that it is ok.
