## Team Rules
Instruction: (from canvas):
There are other forms you may adopt as well, this is just a starting off point.  The main issue we will look for is clarity of your group's "rules" and actually agreement to them.  Your kickoff meeting would be a good place to debate what goes in this document (rules.md) and task out any research or writing to complete it.  To verify agreement to what the contract defines, every group member will have to upload a signed copy (PDF) of the rules to the repo.

Place your team rules in your repo at /admin/misc/rules.md and then each member should add their version named as /admin/misc/rules-studentname.pdf and it should include a signed version of the printed rules.   If I was on your team my file would /admin/misc/rules-thomaspowell.pdf as an example of the format.
