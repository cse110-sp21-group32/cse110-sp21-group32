# Status on the pipeline
## What is currently functional?
Currently, we have successfully implemented the base functionalities of our CI/CD pipeline. This is where we are in terms of completion:

- [x] Linting and code style enforcement (may happen in pipeline and/or in editor)
- [x] Code quality via tool  (ex. Codeclimate, Codacy, etc.)
- [X] Code quality via human review (ex. Pull Requests)
- [ ] Unit tests via automation (ex. Jest, Tape, Ava, Cypress, Mocha/Chai, etc.)*
- [ ] Documentation generation via automation (ex. JSDocs)

Our workflow has 3 jobs: build, test, and Lint Code Base. As of right now, the build job does a simple npm install and npm build:
```
npm install
npm run build --if-present
```

The test job is set as dependable on build job and therefore waits for this one to complete before executing the following commands:
```
npm install
npm test
```

The Lint Code Base job is set to run in parallel. This one is a github repo called [Super Linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter)that is able to run a linter on every programmming language available in our repo. 

Our current diagram looks like this:

Additionally, we chose to setup our repo with a code quality tool, [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/organizations/gh/cse110-sp21-group32/repositories).

## What is planned/in progress?

1. We plan to make our pipeline more robust by adding Unit Tests and Automatic Documentation Generation. 
2. We need to integrate our code quality tool Codacy with our Github workflow.
3. We still have some points to discuss with our stakeholders about pipeline design
