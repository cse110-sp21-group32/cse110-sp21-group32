# Storage Team: Rudy Tony

What's Done:
- Proof of concept for user auth login page
- Used Supabase database/serverside scripting wrapper to simplify our implementation for now, I assume since its not taught in the scope of our class, the prof would not shit on us too hard for not wanting to implement it from scratch. Deepak says we can use whatever for backend.

What will be worked on:
- Research into websockets(?) might not be necessary for our CRUD app.
- Set up demo component for our Tasks to further test storing and updating user data from database.

Other notes:
- I will message the professor to see if my explanation is justified for our implementation
- Check it out! https://test.pageus.site
