# Storage Team: Rudy Tony

What’s done:
- Added working localstorage
- Bullet/category checks will be stored/remembered as well
- Added ids for each category/bullet entry (including new ones) in format id=“bulletX” where X is an integer and id =“cateY” where Y is also an integer. Added the ids to help keep track of bullets/categories that are checked in localstorage. We can remove the ids if necessary though.

What will be worked on:
- Currently after a certain number of categories are added the category-entry id goes from “category 2”,“category3",category”4",category”41",category”411" which is a bug and will be fixed on. Bullet ids work fine though.
