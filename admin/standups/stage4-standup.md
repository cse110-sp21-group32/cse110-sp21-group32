# Storage Team: Rudy Tony

What’s Done:
- Storage integration working for our edit, add, delete functionality. All categories, dates, and bullets will be saved from visit to visit.
-On page refresh, all selected categories and dates reset, TODO if this is to be changed in future.
-If no dates or categories are active, the page will default to entries of today's date, when you add a new bullet it will just appear regardless of whether it should be displayed or not.

TBD:
-We are basically MVP for functionality, it works how we expect it to work, now we just need to make it more sexy.

Other notes:
- Delete function is finished, but I was too lazy to add the delete button CSS
- If you want to delete all just clear offline website data and cache
- I kept the date entry for testing purposes.
- Please check it out on date-selector branch and see if you can break it, I'm sure there are many niche edge cases.
