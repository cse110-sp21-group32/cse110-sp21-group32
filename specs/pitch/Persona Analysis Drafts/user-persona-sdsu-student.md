## Bio
- 3rd year psychology major at SDSU; is good enough at school to get by and content in graduating by any means necessary
- Only in college because wealthy parents are subsidising his education and other "interdisciplinary" pursuits
- Sells cocaine and adderall, understands that the best drug dealers never get hooked on their own supply, dabbles anyway

## Goals
- Make it big on soundcloud
- Turn his side hustle into a full-time occupation first through customer outreach, then by allocating away tasks like distribution in order to focus on inventory upkeep, pipeline management, and aquiring clout
## Frustrations
- Pending felony unrelated to current occupation
- Has to continue to live off parent's wealth due to inability to get a "real" job
- Although business is booming, some long-time customers are on the brink of committing homicide the next time he runs out of supply. Unfortunately, he can only aquire more of his inventory on select days of the week. Lack of foresight has led to running out multiple times in the past, and the problem is not easily solved as proper organization is needed to balance the variable rate at which he sells with the limited opportunities he gets to restock.
## Motivations
- Clout
## Unique Characteristics
- Minor speech impediment/tick aquired from excessively consuming Xanax in high school
- Impulsive to a fault
