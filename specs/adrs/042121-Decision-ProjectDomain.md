#### Date: 0421

In the meeting on 21th April, we decided our project domain to be *day planner*

# Domain of Project

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: All team members
* Date: [2021-04-21] 

## Context and Problem Statement

At the later state of the initialization, we need to decide which domain our project should focus on, so that we have a clearer view of our goals

## Decision Drivers

* Should be practical
* Should be meaningful

## Considered Options

* Finance Planner
* Day Planner
* HW Tracking

## Decision Outcome

We decided to choose Day Planner, becuse it is not complicated as a Finance Planner which could involve lots of equations and terms. It is also more general than HW tracking.
