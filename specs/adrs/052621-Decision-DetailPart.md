# Decision on Duplucate category

* Status: [accepted]
* Deciders: All team members
* Date: [2021-05-26]

## Context and Problem Statement

We have implemented the core functionality of bullet and category filtering. However, we did not decide whether to hide the detial box after hiding the bullet entry.

## Decision Drivers 

* The structure of the focus window should be clear

## Considered Options

* The detial box visibility remains the same after checking or unchecking the category
* The detial box visibility collapses after unchecking the category

## Decision Outcome

We have decided to collapse detial box visibility after unchecking the category to make the focus view cleaner
